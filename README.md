# BeatCraft
A fan-made, faithful recreation of [Beat Saber](https://beatsaber.com/) in Minecraft.

This mod was inspired by deep knowledge of how Beat Saber functions, created from members of the community who have been studying it for years. 

Not only does this mod function like Beat Saber, it's also playable inside virtual reality using [Vivecraft!](https://modrinth.com/mod/vivecraft) This allows for a truly accurate experience, as you'll really be swinging your sabers physically in 3D space!

Experience a unique take on virtual reality's most popular rhythm game, all within the confines of the blocky sandbox we all know and love!
